# **Theater Booking System**

This Java project implements a **Music Theater Booking System** that allows users to manage and reserve theater seats efficiently. It supports different audience types, such as `Adult` and `Child`, and models essential entities including `Movie`, `Person`, and `Seats`.

The system provides a clear demonstration of **object-oriented design**, showcasing how classes interact to handle bookings, seat availability, and pricing logic.

Included demo programs (`demo.java`, `demo2.java`) illustrate the booking workflow, showing how reservations are created and managed in a practical setting. This project is ideal for learning Java OOP principles and building foundational booking system logic.
