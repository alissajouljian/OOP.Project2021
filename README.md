***Theater Booking System***
This Java project implements a simple **Music Theater Booking System**. It manages theater seat reservations for different audience types, including `Adult` and `Child`. The system models key entities such as `Movie`, `Person`, and `Seats`, allowing users to book and track available seats efficiently.

The project includes demo programs (`demo.java`, `demo2.java`) that illustrate the booking process and demonstrate how the classes interact to handle reservations, pricing, and seat management. This project is useful for understanding object-oriented design, class interactions, and basic booking system logic in Java.
